### Notes

- Co-locate unit/integration tests alongside their implementation where practical (e.g., `module_test.py` next to `module.py`, `Component.test.tsx` next to `Component.tsx`).
- Use `pytest` for backend and `pnpm vitest` (or `npm run test`) for frontend; update scripts accordingly.
- Document seeded admin credentials securely and avoid committing actual secrets.

## Tasks

- [x] 1.0 Backend Platform & Database Foundations
  - [x] 1.1 Review existing FastAPI scaffold, define application settings module, and wire environment-based configuration.
  - [x] 1.2 Introduce SQLAlchemy engine/session helpers and register them as FastAPI dependencies.
  - [x] 1.3 Configure Alembic with base migration scripts and generate the initial schema migration for core tables.
  - [x] 1.4 Implement SQLAlchemy models (Users, Profiles, Preferences, Sessions, Categories, Content, Comments, Likes, AuditLogs) with indices and relationships.
  - [x] 1.5 Seed development data script for baseline categories and bootstrap super-admin account.

- [x] 2.0 Backend Authentication & Session Management
  - [x] 2.1 Build registration endpoint with validation, password hashing, pending status, and audit entry.
  - [x] 2.2 Implement email verification tokens, verification endpoint, and pendingâ†’active transition.
  - [x] 2.3 Implement login, refresh, logout endpoints issuing/rotating JWT access + HttpOnly refresh cookies, persisting tokens in `User_Sessions`.
  - [x] 2.4 Implement forgot/reset password flow with time-bound tokens, stub email dispatch, and logging.
  - [x] 2.5 Add in-process rate limiting middleware for auth endpoints (5 attempts per 15 minutes) and tests.

- [x] 3.0 Backend Profiles, Privacy & Preferences
  - [x] 3.1 Implement profile retrieval/update endpoints with validation and audit logging.
  - [x] 3.2 Add avatar upload handling (file validation, resize to 512x512, local storage path management).
  - [x] 3.3 Implement privacy preference persistence (Private/Community/Admin) and enforce visibility rules on profile fetch.
  - [x] 3.4 Implement notification preference toggles (content/community/account) and expose settings endpoint.
