# QA Review: Product Requirements Document for Community App (MVP)

This report provides a detailed quality assurance analysis of the AI-generated Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Community App MVP. The review is based on two core criteria: adherence to the generation workflow and clarity for a junior developer.

## 1. Workflow Compliance Analysis

This section evaluates whether the generated PRD (`tasks/prd-community-app.md`) includes all nine required sections as defined in the workflow document (`ai-dev-tasks/create-prd.md`).

| Section | Required | Present in PRD | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1. Introduction/Overview | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | The section is present and correctly outlines the feature and its purpose. |
| 2. Goals | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | The PRD includes a clear list of project goals. |
| 3. User Stories | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | User stories are detailed and cover the core functionalities. |
| 4. Functional Requirements | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | Functional requirements are listed and numbered, providing clear directives. |
| 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope) | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | The section is present and clearly defines what is out of scope for the MVP. |
| 6. Design Considerations | Optional | Yes | ✅ Pass | The section is included and provides high-level UI/UX guidance. |
| 7. Technical Considerations | Optional | Yes | ✅ Pass | The PRD specifies the tech stack and known technical constraints. |
| 8. Success Metrics | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | The document lists metrics to measure the feature's success. |
| 9. Open Questions | Yes | Yes | ✅ Pass | The PRD includes a section for unresolved questions. |

**Conclusion:** The generated PRD **fully complies** with the structure defined in the workflow document. All required sections are present and correctly implemented.

## 2. Developer-Readiness Review (Tough Questions)

This section lists questions a junior developer would likely ask, highlighting areas of ambiguity or missing detail that could block implementation.

### General

1.  **Priority:** The PRD is extensive for an MVP. Is there a priority order for these features? If we run out of time, what is the absolute "must-have" functionality?

### Section 4.1: Member Sign-Up & Authentication

1.  **Complexity Rules:** What are the specific complexity rules for passwords (e.g., must contain uppercase, number, special character)?
2.  **ToS/Privacy Policy:** Where can I find the content for the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy that users must accept?
3.  **Email Templates:** What should the content of the verification and password reset emails be?
4.  **JWT Implementation:** Is there an existing library or standard we should use for JWT generation and validation? How should the refresh token be stored securely on the client-side (e.g., `localStorage`, `HttpOnly` cookie)?

### Section 4.2: Member Profiles

1.  **Profile Picture:** What are the requirements for profile pictures (e.g., max file size, accepted formats like JPG/PNG, required dimensions)? How should they be stored (e.g., file system, cloud storage like S3)?
2.  **Default Privacy:** What are the default privacy settings for a new user's profile, contact info, and activity status?
3.  **Privacy Granularity:** The requirement mentions controlling visibility (e.g., Public, Private, Admin-only). Does this apply to the entire profile or to individual fields like email and phone number?

### Section 4.3: Member Database

1.  **Audit Logs:** What specific user actions need to be captured in the `Audit_Logs` table? (e.g., login, password change, content download, profile edit).
2.  **Backup Strategy:** The PRD mentions "regular backups." What is the required frequency (e.g., daily, weekly) and retention policy for these backups?
3.  **Schema Definition:** Where can I find the detailed schema definitions for the tables mentioned, including column types, constraints, and relationships?

### Section 4.4: Content Management

1.  **Full-Text Search:** What fields should the full-text search cover? Just `title` and `description`, or also comments and other metadata?
2.  **Content Previews:** How are previews generated? For a document, is it the first page? For a video, is it a thumbnail? Are these generated automatically on upload?
3.  **File Downloads:** Are there any access restrictions on downloads? For instance, can a user download the same file multiple times? Is there a download limit?
4.  **Likes & Comments:** Is there a plan for handling comment moderation or reporting offensive content?
5.  **Admin Dashboard:** What specific features should the admin dashboard for content management include? (e.g., bulk actions, analytics, search/filter for all content).

### Section 4.5: WhatsApp Integration

1.  **API Credentials:** Where can I securely access the API keys and credentials for the WhatsApp Business API?
2.  **Notification Triggers:** The PRD lists notification types. What are the exact system events that trigger each of these notifications?
3.  **Message Templates:** WhatsApp requires pre-approved message templates. Have these templates been created and approved? If not, what should their content be?
4.  **Opt-Out:** The PRD mentions user opt-in. How does a user opt-out of receiving WhatsApp notifications after they've opted in?

### Section 6: Design Considerations

1.  **Guidance:** "A simple, clean design is expected" is very subjective. Is there a branding guide, color palette, or an existing component library I should use to ensure consistency?

### Section 7: Technical Considerations

1.  **Versioning:** Are there required versions for the specified technologies (e.g., Python 3.9+, React 18+)?
2.  **GDPR Compliance:** Are there specific guidelines or a checklist for ensuring GDPR compliance during development?
